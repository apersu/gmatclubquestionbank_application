Thanks : ) <br/> <br/> Question: <br/> Images from ground-based telescopes are invariably distorted by the Earth's atmosphere. Orbiting space telescopes, however, operating above Earth's atmosphere, should provide superbly detailed images. Therefore, ground-based telescopes will soon become obsolete for advanced astronomical research purposes. <br/> <br/> Which of the following statements, if true, would cast the most doubt on the conclusion drawn above? <br/> <br/> (A) An orbiting space telescope due to be launched this year is far behind schedule and over budget, whereas the largest ground-based telescope was both within budget and on schedule. <br/> <br/> (B) Ground-based telescopes located on mountain summits are not subject to the kinds of atmospheric distortion which, at low altitudes, make stars appear to twinkle. <br/> <br/> (C) By careful choice of observatory location, it is possible for large-aperture telescopes to avoid most of the kind of wind turbulence that can distort image quality. <br/> <br/> (D) When large-aperture telescopes are located at high altitudes near the equator, they permit the best Earth-based observations of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, a prime target of astronomical research. <br/> <br/> (E) Detailed spectral analyses, upon which astronomers rely for determining the chemical composition and evolutionary history of stars, require telescopes with more light-gathering capacity than space telescopes can provide. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> My Reasoning: <br/> <br/> My initial answer was (B), and still is. As for answer choice (E), I'm unconvinced because the answer choice doesn't point out unambiguously that Earth-based telescopes have that light-gathering capacity that space-based telescopes fall short, even though the explanation just inexplicably claims that capacity for Earth-based telescopes. As a non-expert in this field, I suppose the test takers aren't supposed to infer that space-based and Earth-based telescopes are only two categories of telescopes in a dichotomy, or that Earth-based telescopes inherently have a better light-gathering capacity that the space-based ones. <br/> <br/> As for answer (B), from the viewpoint of a domain illiterate, the reference of \"make stars appear to twinkle\" doesn't come over as downright inferior and worth being rendered obsolete; the answer actually came over as \"The problem with atmospheric distortion becomes abated, to whatever extent, when ground-based telescopes are located on mountain summits; hence, can still be of some use\". My choice of (B) over (E) bases primarily on the fact that (E) doesn't explicitly claim for ground-based telescopes the capacity that would make it more useful than space-based ones in that particular regard, while (B) explicitly points out how the weakness of ground-based telescopes can be offset. <br/> <br/> Thank you : ) <div class=\"item twoRowsBlock\" onclick=\"hide('spoiler_1597980');\">  <div class=\"upRow\">   <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">    [Reveal]   </a>   Spoiler: OA  </div>  <div class=\"downRow\" id=\"spoiler_1597980\" style=\"display: none\">   E  </div> </div></div>", "answer": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tE\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}, {"used": "No", "response": "NA", "question_type": "CR_HIGH       S", "question": "<div class=\"item text\"> Scientists have genetically modified three pigs so that they are thoroughly florescent both in daylight and in darkness.

Skateboarding in the town's River Park is undoubtedly dangerous, but we should not pass an ordinance prohibiting it.  If children cannot skateboard in the park, they will most certainly skateboard in the streets.  And skateboarding in the streets is more dangerous that skateboarding in the park. <br/> <br/> <br/> The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the town councilor's argument? <br/> <br/> (a) The reason for requiring environmental reviews is to ensure that projected developments do not harm the natural environment.  Currently, environmental concerns are less compelling than economic concerns, but in the long run, the environment must be protected.  Therefore, the requirement for environmental reviews should not be waived. <br/> (b) Insecticides are designed to protect crops against insect damage.  Aphids damage tomato crops, but using insecticides against aphids kills wasps that prey on insecticide-resistant pests.  Since aphids damage tomato crops less than the insecticide-resistant pests  do, insecticides should not be used against aphids on tomato crops. <br/> (c) The purpose of compulsory vaccination for schoolchildren was to protect both the children themselves and others in the community against smallpox.  Smallpox was indeed a dreadful disease, but it has now been eliminated from the word's population.  So children should not be vaccinated against it. <br/> (d) The function of a sealer on wood siding is to retard deterioration caused by weather.  However, cedar is a wood that is naturally resistant to weather-related damage and thus does not need additional protection.  Sealers, therefore, should not be applied to cedar siding. <br/> (e) Traffic patterns that involve one-way streets are meant to accelerate the flow of traffic in otherwise congested areas.

The difficulty of the task is compounded by the fact that three of the most common critical reasoning question types, assumption, weaken and strengthen, rely on assumptions as the basis for getting a correct answer. <br/> This article will address one common pattern of reasoning, the causal argument.  It describes how a causal argument is constructed, how to find the conclusion and the premises and most importantly how the test constructs answers that can confuse test takers.  If you can identify an argument as causal during your first read, you can cut down on the confusion associated with them and spot the typical types of answers, thus improving your verbal score. <br/> <br/> A <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">  Causal argument </span> comes to the conclusion that one thing is caused by another thing.  Most commonly the premise is that one thing happened before the other, therefore the earlier even caused the latter.  For instance an argument might read \u201cThe baby started crying loudly one minute before his brother woke up.  Since the baby and his brother share a room, it is clear that the baby\u2019s crying woke his brother.\u201d  This argument concludes that there is a causal relationship between the two events \u2013 that the crying caused the brother to wake up.  This relationship seems quite reasonable, we have all had some experience with noise waking people up.  Yet the fact that it could happen is not enough to prove causality.  For instance, if you claim that you washed your car today and then it rained, therefore washing your car must have caused the rain, the relationship is revealed as logically inconsistent.  It is this very logical inconsistency that the test writers use to trick students. <br/> <br/> <p style=\"font-size:125%;color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">  Causal Assumptions </p> <br/> <br/> When the argument claims that one thing caused another because one happened before the other or that the two events happened at the same time, the assumption is either that the proposed cause actually caused the effect or that there was no other intervening cause.  For example in the argument: <br/> <br/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">  In the last 20 years, there has been a significant increase in coffee consumption.  During this same time period, there has been an increasing number of public coffee shops in urban areas.  Therefore, the increase in the number of public coffee shops must have caused the increase in coffee consumption. </span> <br/> <br/> The author assumes the causal relationship without actually establishing it as fact.  Therefore, a correct answer to an assumption question would be one that establishes that having the public coffee houses did indeed cause the increase in coffee consumption or that there was no other cause for the increase in the consumption of coffee. <br/> <br/> <p style=\"font-size:125%;color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">  Weakening Causal Arguments </p> <br/> <br/> In order to weaken this type of argument, the GMAT requires you to find a reason why the cause/effect relationship is not established.  One way to do this is to establish that there was an <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">  alternate or intervening cause for the result </span> .  This type of correct answer is often difficult to spot because it brings in new information that does not seem connected to the argument.  Thus, an answer choice that says \u201cin the past 20 years, people have been made increasingly aware of the health benefits of coffee\u201d would weaken the argument because it introduces a possible alternate cause and thus shows a break in the causal relationship the author wishes to establish. <br/> <br/> Similarly, an answer choice that <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">  reverses the causal relationship </span> will weaken the argument.   An answer choice such as \u201cpublic coffee houses have been increasing as a result of the increase in consumption of coffee\u201d gives a fact that shows that the relationship is the reverse of what the author concludes, and thus it weakens the argument.  These types of answers can be easier to spot, but, unfortunately, they, are less common. <br/> <br/> <p style=\"font-size:125%;color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">  Strengthening Causal Arguments </p> <br/> <br/> Strengthening a causal argument can be a very difficult task.  One way to strengthen an argument is to state the assumption.  Thusly, an answer that says \u201cthe public coffee houses are the only cause of increase in coffee consumption\u201d would be correct.  However most test takers will not choose this answer because they believe it to be a restatement of facts in the paragraph.  On careful inspection the addition of the word only give the reader new information, which eliminates all other possible causes for the increase.  In this way, the answer would strengthen the argument. <br/> <br/> However, eliminating all possible causes is not necessary for an answer to a strengthen question.  Simply <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">  eliminating other possible causes </span> also serves to strengthen the argument, albeit much less than eliminating all possible causes.   Thus an answer choice that eliminates another possible cause is often the answer to some of the most difficult strengthen questions.  For instance, an answer that reads \u201cThe price of coffee has not dramatically decreased in the past 20 years\u201d would strengthen the argument.  At first glance, cost seems completely out of scope, but it is relevant.  Cost is one factor that affects peoples\u2019 purchases, and, if the cost of an item decreases dramatically, it can cause consumption to rise, Thus, the fact that the price has not risen, eliminates this as a possible cause and strengthens the argument.  Eliminating a possible other cause is a common way the GMAT answers this type of question, and because the possible cause is off topic and the answer choice says it did not happen, students often have a difficult time choosing the answer.  Thus, opening up to the possibility of this type of answer, and recognizing the relevance will help to improve your accuracy on the Critical Reasoning Section. <br/> _________________ <br/> <p>  <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=PJTlq5NYqfE&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=257726.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9275&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.princetonreview.com\" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\" rel=\"nofollow\">   <span style=\"color: #ed1c24\">    Special offer   </span>  </a>  !

In market surveys, few respondents who had been exposed to SuperComp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising campaign said they thought there was no point in owning a home computer. <br/> <br/> B. People who own a home computer often buy a second such computer, but only rarely do people buy a third computer. <br/> <br/> C. SuperComp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealers also sell other brands of computers that are very similar to SuperComp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but less expensive and that afford the dealers a significantly higher markup. <br/> <br/> D. The dealers who were chosen to sell SuperComp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computers were selected in part because their stores are located in shopping centers that attract relatively wealthy shoppers. <br/> <br/> E. Computer-industry analysts believed before the SuperComp campaign began that most consumers who already owned home computers were not yet ready to replace them. <br/> _________________ <br/> <p>  <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">   <span style=\"color: #459926\">    New to the Math Forum?   </span>  </span>  <br/>  Please read this:  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/new-to-the-math-forum-please-read-this-first-140445.html\">   <span style=\"color: #007ec6\">    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">     All You Need for Quant    </span>   </span>  </a>  |  <span style=\"color: #ff0000\">   PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  </span>  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/11-rules-for-posting-133935.html\">   <span style=\"color: #ff0000\">    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">     12 Rules for Posting!!!    </span>   </span>  </a>  <br/>  <br/>  <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">   <span style=\"color: #459926\">    Resources:   </span>  </span>  <br/>  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/gmat-math-book-in-downloadable-pdf-format-130609.html\">   <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">    GMAT Math Book   </span>  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/everything-about-triangles-for-gmat-87197.html\">   Triangles  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/everything-about-polygons-for-gmat-87336.html\">   Polygons  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/coordinate-geometry-87652.html\">   Coordinate Geometry  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/everything-about-factorials-on-the-gmat-85592.html\">   Factorials  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/math-circles-87957.html\">   Circles  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/math-number-theory-88376.html\">   Number Theory  </a>  |  <a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://gmatclub.com/forum/remainders-144665.html\">   Remainders  </a>  ;

Therefore, replacement of standard keyboards with the EFCO keyboard will result in an immediate reduction of typing costs. <br/> <br/> Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the conclusion drawn above? <br/> <br/> (A) People who use both standard and EFCO keyboards report greater difficulty in the transition from the EFCO keyboard to the standard keyboard than in the transition from the standard keyboard to the EFCO keyboard. <br/> (B) EFCO keyboards are no more expensive to manufacture than are standard keyboards and require less frequent repair than do standard keyboards. <br/> (C) The number of businesses and government agencies that use EFCO keyboards is increasing each year. <br/> (D) The more training and experience an employee has had with the standard keyboard, the more costly it is to train that employee to use the EFCO keyboard. <br/> (E) Novice typists can learn to use the EFCO keyboard in about the same amount of time it takes them to learn to use the standard keyboard. <br/> <br/> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">  <span style=\"color: #BF0000\">   <span style=\"font-size: 60%; line-height: normal\">    <a class=\"th23autolinks postlink\" href=\"http://mbabookshop.com/books/the-official-guide-for-gmat-review-10th-edition\" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Look up details\">     OG10    </a>    : CR-Q158   </span>  </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <div class=\"item twoRowsBlock\" onclick=\"hide('spoiler_973065');\">  <div class=\"upRow\">   <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">    [Reveal]   </a>   Spoiler: OA  </div>  <div class=\"downRow\" id=\"spoiler_973065\" style=\"display: none\">   D  </div> </div></div>", "question_type": "CR_LOW        I", "response": "NA", "used": "No"}];
