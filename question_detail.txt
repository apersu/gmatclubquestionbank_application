									Last year, all of the medical waste at County Hospital was sterilized by autoclaving, then shredded. This process generated a large quantity of unusable material that ended up in a landfill. In order to reduce its trash this year to half of last yearâ€™s total, the hospital has updated its waste removal practices. This year, it will autoclave all waste and then incinerate all non-plastic medical waste. This should decrease the number of tons of waste sent to the landfill by half. Which of the following is required for the updated waste removal program to achieve its aim? A. This year, the hospital will incinerate all possible materials. B. The total quantity of medical waste generated at the hospital this year will be no greater than that generated last year. C. The waste shredded this year will weigh no more than the waste shredded last year D. Medical waste generated by County Hospital will contain a larger proportion of non-plastic waste this year than it did last year. E. Separating plastic from non-plastic waste will cost the hospital half of what it cost last year to send the waste to landfills.
